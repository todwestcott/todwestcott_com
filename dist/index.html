That’s what biotech firm Gentra and a
           partnering research hospital did.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Gentra hoped it had a new cancer cure. The initial trial reaped a batch of complete remissions. Ecstatic,
           Gentra prepared to market their chemotherapy treatment nationwide, at a cool half million per treatment.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>But Dr. Timothy Carrol, the oncologist overseeing the trial, discovered Gentra's chemo had not caused the
           miraculous cures. The cures happened through an attending nurse, Nurse Rosemary, who prayed with patients who
           asked her to join them in healing prayer.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>When Gentra's hospital partner learned about Nurse Rosemary, they fired her. They couldn’t risk a Bible
           believing nurse receiving credit for cures they attributed to the chemo protocol.
</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6></p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>As a lifelong atheist, Dr. Carrol’s instinct was to take the hospital’s side. In material terms, he had
           everything he could want. A glamorous wife. A palatial home backed up to the city’s most prestigious golf
           course. A five-car garage filled with luxury automobiles. The approval of his world-renowned heart-surgeon
           father.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> His riches would rocket if he kept his mouth shut and went along with the lie that Gentra's chemo caused the
            cancer cures. So, at first, he did not come to Nurse Rosemary’s defense.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> But one horrifying night in the emergency room, Jesus appeared before Dr. Carrol and opened his eyes. He saw
            that demonic powers caused many diseases. And, in that moment, Jesus gave Dr. Carrol the gift of healing. On
            the spot, he healed a cancer patient by laying on hands and calling on the name of Jesus.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> Dr. Carrol was forever changed. A change that cost him everything. But what he lost in the worldly realm, he
            gained in the spiritual realm. He teamed up with Nurse Rosemary and prayer warrior Pastor Jacob. With them,
            he learned the truth of what Paul wrote: “Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the
            rulers, authorities, powers, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”</p></div><div class="img" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6><img src="/_astro/unholy_university_cover.80ea4199_27RfuJ.webp" alt="cover for Unholy Medicine" class="my_img" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6 width="600" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unholy-University-Tod-Westcott-ebook/dp/B0B9KJGR25/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3IMAEDU8R5CAN&keywords=unholy+university&qid=1696210677&sprefix=unholy+university%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6><button data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Buy on Amazon</button></a></div><div class="book_description" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6><h1 class="book_description" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Unholy University</h1><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
What would you do if you were a professor of evolution and Jesus showed you the truth of God’s creation?
            That’s what happened to Professor Ryan Wood in a near death experience. He was awestruck.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> Before Jesus' intervention, Professor Wood was a hard core atheist. He abused his teaching position to
            obliterate belief in Jesus Christ. His best-selling books on atheism won him guest appearances on cable news
            and TV morning shows. But after Jesus appeared to him, he was eager to reveal the truth. As a renowned
            scientist, Professor Wood was used to the public treating his words as gospel. He expected his revelation
            that God is the creator of life to be received as breaking news. He was so wrong.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> The networks banned him from future appearances. The students who flocked to his classes mocked him and
            walked out. His university schemed to defraud him of his tenure and run him off campus.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> Ryan Wood would not slip away without a fight. Jesus also showed him that his aggressive atheism handed
            unwary students over to the soul-destroying evils of Satan. He was desperate to win those souls back for
            Jesus, and to break the university’s cancel-Christ agenda dictating the university curriculum.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> But he could not win the battle alone. He found a surprise ally in Elizabeth Williams, a courageous,
            believing student. The two together exposed a system that would resort to murder to keep its grip on
            power.</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> Unholy University is a true-to-life novel revealing how the university attacks and suppresses Christian
            belief. </p></div><footer data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6><div data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Jesus Christ is real. He walked this earth 2000 years ago. He was crucified. He was raised with mighty
             power from the dead by God the Father. He is eternally alive today. He is waiting for you to join him in
             the glory of God's creation. Jesus is the pinnacle of the creation: King of kings; Lord of lords. By
             opening your heart in love to him, he relates to you as your eternally loving brother. You bring yourself
             into the truth of what this creation we live in is all about. And your greatest adventure begins.
